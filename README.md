# Top Coding Interview Tasks

Implementations of the most common coding interview tasks, focusing on data structures, algorithms, and their complexities.

## The Top Tasks

The top 21 most typical Leetcode/Hackerrank tasks for senior software developer coding interviews focused on data structures, algorithms, and [**Big O** complexities](Code_Complexity.md):

1. **Two Sum** - Find two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target.
2. **Reverse a Linked List** - Reverse a singly linked list.
3. **Merge Two Sorted Lists** - Merge two sorted linked lists into one sorted list.
4. **Binary Search** - Implement binary search in a sorted array.
5. **Valid Parentheses** - Determine if a string of parentheses is valid.
6. **Maximum Depth of Binary Tree** - Find the maximum depth of a binary tree.
7. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters** - Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
8. **Climbing Stairs** - Count the number of ways to climb a staircase with n steps, where each time you can climb 1 or 2 steps.
9. **Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array** - Find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array.
10. **Word Ladder** - Find the shortest transformation sequence from one word to another.
11. **Permutations** - Generate all possible permutations of a list of numbers.
12. **Subsets** - Generate all possible subsets of a list of numbers.
13. **Number of Islands** - Count the number of islands in a 2D grid.
14. **Meeting Rooms** - Determine if a person can attend all meetings given their start and end times.
15. **Find Median from Data Stream** - Find the median of a stream of numbers.
16. **Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree** - Convert a binary tree to a string and back to a binary tree.
17. **Product of Array Except Self** - Return an array such that each element is the product of all other elements.
18. **Kth Largest Element in an Array** - Find the k-th largest element in an array.
19. **Sliding Window Maximum** - Find the maximum in each sliding window of size k in an array.
20. **Longest Increasing Subsequence** - Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an array.
21. **Merge Intervals** - Merge overlapping intervals in an array of intervals.

These tasks cover a broad range of essential topics such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and sorting, often tested in coding interviews for senior software developers, see at [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/blog/coding-interview-questions-programmers-should-know/), [MakeThatContent](https://forsoftwareengineers.com/interview/coding/leetcode/patterns/), [IGotAnOffer](https://igotanoffer.com/blogs/tech/algorithms-interview-questions), or [HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/14-patterns-to-ace-any-coding-interview-question-c5bb3357f6ed).
